Summary
I practiced using the basic Git commands to set up and manage a local repository. Here’s what I did:
Initialized the Repository:
I navigated to my project folder in the terminal and ran git init. This created a .git folder, marking it as a Git repository.
Observation: The command was straightforward, and no issues occurred.
Staged Files for Commit:
I created a sample text file named example.txt and added it to the staging area using git add example.txt.
I also tested git add . to stage all changes in the folder.
Error Encountered: Initially, I forgot to run git add and tried committing directly. Git displayed a message indicating there were no staged changes.
Resolution: I staged the file and retried the commit.
Committed Changes:
I used git commit -m "Initial commit" to save the changes to the repository.
Observation: I learned the importance of writing meaningful commit messages to track changes effectively.
Additional Notes:
I used git status frequently to check the repository’s state. It helped me identify whether files were staged or untracked.
The commands were simple to use once I understood the workflow.
Key Takeaways:
The sequence git init > git add > git commit is essential to remember.
Using git status before each step helped avoid errors.
Git provides clear error messages, making it easier to identify and resolve issues.
